# Learning Python — README

This repository is a personal, day-by-day learning journal and collection of exercises for learning Python. It documents daily goals, experiments, short exercises, notes, and small projects so both I and other readers can follow progress and reproduce examples.

## How to read this repo
- The journal is organized by day (Day 1, Day 2, ...). Start with `day01.py` and proceed by increasing day numbers.
- Each day contains a short narrative, code examples, and links to related notes or exercises.


## How to run examples
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
     - python3 -m venv .venv
     - source .venv/bin/activate (macOS/Linux) or .venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
2. Install dependencies (if any):
     - pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run a day's example script:
     - python day01.py
4. Open a notebook:
     - jupyter notebook or jupyter lab

## Notes & best practices for readers
- Entries are intentionally concise — day folders are chronological learning snapshots.
- If you reuse code from here, credit the repository and note the day entry.
- Refactor old days when revisiting topics to show growth.

## Contributing / Feedback
- Suggestions are welcome: open an issue with the day number and a short note.
- Pull requests should follow the daily folder pattern and include a short README in the day folder.

Thanks for reading — follow the days in order to see stepwise progress and runnable examples.
